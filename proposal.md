# neonFabric

## Summary
Combine a piece of fabric and neon light. The neon light will give feedback for interactions. The neon light will be a wire and will be attached to a piece of trasparent fabric. The fabric, essentially the sensor will be able to recognize where the interactor touches and give feedback by lighting up the part of light. The light will stay on until the interator touches the next time. 


## Component Parts

I will need a capacitive sensor in order to tell where on the fabric interacter touches. A neon light is needed too. And a piece of fabric and the stuff to attach the light with the fabric.

## Challenges

It would be challenging to connect capacitive sensor to the light: I need to figure out how the sensor recognize the touch and transform that to work with the light. I have never worked with sensors and neon lights. And I don't know which type to sensor to get. I will have to see how can I control the neon light in order to get it partially lit up. 


## Timeline
